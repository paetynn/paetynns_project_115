# Law Enforcement Settlement Data
# Motivation
I have been passionate about the justice system in the United States since I was in middle school. For this project, I initially had other ideas that I thought would have made stronger points. However, I could not follow through with those ideas due to lack of information, data privacy, and lack of time. When I found this dataset, I realized I wanted to take a less targeted approach and leave insights to viewer speculation. I wanted to know how these variables correlated with one another, and thought it would be interesting to know how others percieved the results. I retrieved this data from FiveThirtyEight, specifically from an article titled, "Cities Spend Millions On Police Misconduct Every Year. Here’s Why It’s So Difficult to Hold Departments Accountable." By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, Laura Bronner and Damini Sharma. 
A couple of years ago, I took a sociology class and learned of the inner-city cycle, which says that impoverished indivudals and families in inner cities suffer systematically. For this reason, I piqued an interest in Detroit.
# Data Sources
As stated previously, I obtained this data from an article on FiveThirtyEight. The link to the article is https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/. The actual data was provided in the following link: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements/.
# Data Process
In the original data, settlement information for 31 cities was provided. Each city had extensive data, so I had to narrow it down to one for this project. I chose Detroit because I have a special interest in inner-city criminal justice and opression. Data from 2010 to 2019 was provided within this file, and I chose to include data from 2017-2019. Due to the formatting of the raw data, I had to manually input each cell in Excel. The columns I chose to include were date, amount of settlement, title of settlement, and cause. There were several blanks in the zipcode column, as well as two settlements from Chicago that I cleared from the sheet. I also converted all columns to factors to perform analysis. After cleaning, the result was 159 entries from 2017-2019 in Detroit, MI.
