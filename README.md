# Law Enforcement Settlement Data
# Motivation
I have been passionate about the justice system in the United States since I was in middle school. For this project, I initially had other ideas that I thought would have made stronger points. However, I could not follow through with those ideas due to lack of information, data privacy, and lack of time. When I found this dataset, I realized I wanted to take a less targeted approach and leave insights to viewer speculation. I wanted to know how these variables correlated with one another, and thought it would be interesting to know how others percieved the results. I retrieved this data from FiveThirtyEight, specifically from an article titled, "Cities Spend Millions On Police Misconduct Every Year. Here’s Why It’s So Difficult to Hold Departments Accountable." by By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, Laura Bronner and Damini Sharma. 
A couple of years ago, I took a sociology class and learned of the inner city cycle, which says that impoverished indivudals and families in inner cities suffer systematically.
